This plugin gets your pins from Pinterest and displays them on your site via a widget which we’ve made responsive so it will adapt to your theme!

== Description ==

This plugin was designed and developed by Brightpath Media. Check us out at www.brightpathmedia.co.uk

Pinterest has an API for interacting with it’s service and delivering content to your site, however, its not finished yet… The public API is not yet available and current you can only make a request for the beta developer version.

<strong>Why you need this plugin:</strong>
So, what do you do if you want to display your pin’s on your website or blog? Well if you are using WordPress you are in luck! We've developed a plugin which gives you a widget that can grab your pins from Pinterest and display them on your site. What makes this plugin special is that we made the widget responsive so it will adapt to your theme design and if you are using a responsive theme, it will adapt to the various different states and devices that view your site!

<strong>Tips for using our plugin:</strong>
The widget looks best when used in a wider widget area than your typical sidebar, such as a footer widget area. This is not to say that if you are looking to display your pins in the standard sidebar layout that this plugin won’t work. When setting up the widget simply set the ‘Responsive or Fixed’ setting to fixed and set the width of the pins in pixels to match that of your sidebar areas’s width or try experimenting with the Responsive setting!

<strong>Support:</strong>
